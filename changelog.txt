=========
Build: 1.16.5-Alpha 8 / Beta 4
	* Now Building against Mana & Artifice 1.5.0.10
	* Fixed bug with wakebloom seeds not placing correctly on fluids
	* Reformatted much code for general cleanup
	* Backend refactoring for uniform naming conventions
	* Backend changes to conform to Mana & Artifice updates
	* Updated/Added codex entries
	+ Added Ritual of Catharsis : cleanses your body of magical residue, resets your affinity attunements and potentially removes other magical effects
	+ Mana Monocle is finally no longer completely useless: right click a block with an empty hand inside the area of a warding candle to render the candle's aoe, shift right click with an empty hand to clear it
	+ Ritual of Unspelling now requires chimerite crystals like Ritual of Catharsis and the construct workbench do, as well as mana resevoirs
	+ Particlezz
	- Removed original Mana Monocle hud element finally
=========
Build: 1.16.5-Alpha 7 / Beta 3
	* Now Building against Mana & Artifice 1.4.0.8
	* Updated Mana Monocle to handle alternative casting resources, it doesnt display them, it just wont crash, it's still pretty pointless
	* Cleaned up the objectively terrible Hud renderer just a little bit- its not going to be around much longer anyway
	* Added and removed a few Mana Monocle function ideas that turned out to not be feasible with current api limitations and so are just sitting around as full-file comments waiting for the next update
	+ Added alternative nostalgic method for obtaining the Codex Arcana and config to enable it
	+ Added a much better, more satisfying, frustration relieving way to recycle botched rune patterns, but only as an additional function to the already frustration relieving way of disposing of them
	+ Ritual of Treachery : Leave your current faction, return to tier 2 & magic level 29 to be able to choose another, your abandoned faction will not be happy
	+ Codex Arcana entry on Ritual of Treachery, pretty long and wordy but hopefully explains the intricacies of an entirely dynamic ritual well enough
	- Removed the old, kinda buggy, very boring runic anvil recipes for recycling botched rune patterns
	- Removed the old, entirely redundant, tooltip additions to several Mana & Artifice items
=========
Build: 1.16.5-Alpha 6 / Beta 2
	* Now Building against 1.16.5 - Mana & Artifice 1.3.0.5
	* Although Redundant, the Mana Monocle will continue to show mana numbers, until I have time to implement the new function I want to give it
	* Constructs are still behaving kind of strangely with desert nova and wakebloom seeds- just tag them farmland plantable as workaround
	+ Fixed Ritual of Unspelling crash with non-creative-crafted spells, intentionally does not return complexity reagents 
	+ Added loot table to vinteum powder so it drops itself when broken, would think I'd have noticed that sooner
	+ Added '[AF]' tag to codex entries to distinguish them from base Mana & Artifice entries
	- Removed some Spellbook Tooltips, Mana & Artifice has its own now
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 5.2 / Beta 1.2
	+ Fixed Mana Monocle recipe not being craftable at it's intended unlock tier
	+ All crops now have valid ground configurable via tags, however only wakebloom can be placed directly on fluids
	+ More spellbook tooltip improvements, apparently they just dont like normal java String syntax
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 5.1 / Beta 1.1
	+ Fixed a crash on servers due to the mana monocle because I guess it wasnt really ready for a release.
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 5 / Beta 1
	* Released as Beta just because curseforge doesnt like alpha mods
	+ Mana Monocle, curio equippable in head slot, displays numerical mana values in a HUD element
	+ Mana Monocle manaweaving recipe, included under artifice tab of codex
	+ Command: /afuicfg, for now all it does is take x and y values to move the mana monocle hud element
	+ Config File currently just stores position of mana monocle hud element
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 4
	+ Vinteum Powder, vinteum dust compression block; effectively blue sand
	+ Better logic for spellbook tooltips
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 3
	+ Spellbook usage tooltip details updated
	+ Desert Nova and Wakebloom crops valid soil now configurable with tags
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 2
	+ Ritual of Unspelling: uncrafts spells
	+ Guidebook entries
	+ Implemented tags
	+ Added usage tips to spellbook tooltips
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 1
	Initial release: flower crops and some utility recipes
