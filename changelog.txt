=========
Build: 1.16.5-Alpha 6 / Beta 2
	* Now Building against 1.16.5 - Mana & Artifice 1.3.0.5
	* Although Redundant, the Mana Monocle will continue to show mana numbers, until I have time to implement the new function I want to give it
	* Constructs are still behaving kind of strangely with desert nova and wakebloom seeds- just tag them farmland plantable as workaround
	+ Fixed Ritual of Unspelling crash with non-creative-crafted spells, intentionally does not return complexity reagents 
	+ Added loot table to vinteum powder so it drops itself when broken, would think I'd have noticed that sooner
	+ Added '[AF]' tag to codex entries to distinguish them from base Mana & Artifice entries
	- Removed some Spellbook Tooltips, Mana & Artifice has its own now
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 5.2 / Beta 1.2
	+ Fixed Mana Monocle recipe not being craftable at it's intended unlock tier
	+ All crops now have valid ground configurable via tags, however only wakebloom can be placed directly on fluids
	+ More spellbook tooltip improvements, apparently they just dont like normal java String syntax
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 5.1 / Beta 1.1
	+ Fixed a crash on servers due to the mana monocle because I guess it wasnt really ready for a release.
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 5 / Beta 1
	* Released as Beta just because curseforge doesnt like alpha mods
	+ Mana Monocle, curio equippable in head slot, displays numerical mana values in a HUD element
	+ Mana Monocle manaweaving recipe, included under artifice tab of codex
	+ Command: /afuicfg, for now all it does is take x and y values to move the mana monocle hud element
	+ Config File currently just stores position of mana monocle hud element
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 4
	+ Vinteum Powder, vinteum dust compression block; effectively blue sand
	+ Better logic for spellbook tooltips
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 3
	+ Spellbook usage tooltip details updated
	+ Desert Nova and Wakebloom crops valid soil now configurable with tags
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 2
	+ Ritual of Unspelling: uncrafts spells
	+ Guidebook entries
	+ Implemented tags
	+ Added usage tips to spellbook tooltips
=========
Build: 1.16.4-Alpha 1
